# Alzheimer-detection
Machine Learning Algorithm for Alzheimer Detection
The purpose of this algorithm is to train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to perform a MRI (Magnetic Resonnance Images) segmentation exercise in order to detect Alzheimer disease by looking at thousands of images from wide variety of brains in different conditions: non demented, very mild demented, mild demented and moderate demented. The dataset has been pulled from Kaggle site (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sachinkumar413/alzheimer-mri-dataset/code)
